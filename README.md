## Inspiration
If there is one thing that binds Singaporeans strongly, it is our love (or hate) for our unique brand of English - Singlish. In text, online memes, and even popular media, seeing people speak or type in Singlish often incites a sense of harmony and humour amongst the crowd. Regardless of race, language or religion, **Singlish binds us**. So, our awesomely useless bot finds a way to add just a bit more of that Singlish touch to everyday texts.

## What it does
EchoButSinglishBot takes in any text message you send it and makes it more Singaporean but adding a Singlish term before and after the message.
'I went to the doctor today' --> 'Eh i went to the doctor today sia'

## How we built it
We built it using simple python code and the python telegram bot apis.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced some troubles while downloading the python-bot and when configuring the correct environment for package downloads before development. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It made us laugh. It made our friends laugh too. Try it yourself, it might make you laugh! 

## Try EchoButSinglishBot
1) Open Telegram
2) Search for @EchoButSinglishBot
3) Click on Start
4) Type in any un-Singlish message (Be as British as you can) and press Enter

## What we learned
Coding doesn't always need to be super complex. Sometimes a simple, awesome idea can bring joy to the people around us. Chill a bit and build what makes you happy. ^.^

## What's next for EchoButSinglishBot
Instead of plainly echoing, EchoButSinglishBot will work on having automated, Singlish replies, such as 'steady la bro' or 'shag sia' or 'don't liddat can'.
